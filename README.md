Brief Bio about yourself
I first took programming classes in high school in the 1970s, using an Olivetti Programa 101.  I learned BASIC, ForTran, and COBOL in high school.  When I went to the university, I began Pascal, PL/I, RPG and others using punched cards.  I got my first job in the computer industry while I was still in high school - where I punched cards, mounted tapes, mounted removable disk packs, and more.  I also worked in the university computing center as a student programmer.  After university, I worked in the travel industry as a programmer and worked my way up to executive level management where I managed a state-wide network for a company in Hawaii.  Iʻm in my 33rd year of teaching at Leeward Community College where I am the ICS program coordinator repsonsible for a staff of 8 full-time faculty, 4 full-time lecturers, and about 15 part-time lecturers.
